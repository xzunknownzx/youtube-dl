15:21:32 [32minfo[39m=Enhanced translation: This software is really good, but there are a few issues I'd like to point out. First, when you select Hindi, it gives you options to choose a region, including Haryanvi and Rajasthani. But Haryanvi and Rajasthani aren't dialects of Hindi. These are languages that are only spoken and not written, and they don't have their own script. However, they do use some Hindi words.
